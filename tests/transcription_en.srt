1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Oh, sweet summer children, it's good a lot here, program to fact check your daily dose

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,320
of TikTok propaganda.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,920
So, let's take a quick trip to Truth Town, shall we?

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,080
First off, Red Roofs.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
Seriously?

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
They are Mediterranean tradition, not an apartheid sign.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,360
To make sure, check your local IKEA for red tiles, they might be plotting something.

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,520
Now, onto those pesky checkpoints.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,680
They're not ideal, we get it.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,440
But what's the alternative?

11
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,440
You tell me.

12
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,240
No, seriously?

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,760
Tell me how to stop suicide bombers without them?

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,960
And that airport?

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,880
Yeah, it got bombed, but let's not forget the context, shall we?

16
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,640
After some, let's say, unfriendly activities.

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,160
Lastly, the water issue.

18
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,480
It's a big problem, no doubt.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,080
But guess who offer tech to help solve this?

20
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,080
Israel.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,960
Talk about being a petty bitch, right?

22
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,560
So, before you dive into that pool of TikTok misinformation, how about we dip our toes into

23
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,520
the CFX first?

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,760
Your move, TikTok.
