[00:18.640 --> 00:20.640]  Tragic, absolutely.

[00:09.300 --> 00:14.500]  Well, what I discovered was that there was a movement that began over a century ago

[00:27.880 --> 00:31.720]  and LGBT plus folks, enjoy equal rights?
[00:31.720 --> 00:33.040]  Tragic indeed.
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.680]  Now, about profoundly and negatively impacting your country, unless you're allergic to innovation
[00:38.680 --> 00:42.480]  and progress, Israel's impact can hardly be negative.
[00:42.480 --> 00:47.520]  How about we do a fact check next time before we jump on the blame train, shall we?

[00:09.000 --> 00:18.000]  Fact check, Zionism sought to establish a safe haven for Jews who, you know, faced just a bit of persecution throughout history.
[00:18.000 --> 00:20.000]  They say it's negative?
[00:20.000 --> 00:28.000]  How about being the only democracy in the Middle East, where women, LGBTQ plus folks, and all religions have rights?
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  You know, those liberal values? Try finding that elsewhere in the region.
[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  And as for dangerously impacting the world, Israel's tech, medical and science innovations might disagree.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  Ever heard of a disk on key? Yep, that's Israeli.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  So, is Zionism still the big, bad wolf you thought it was?

[00:13.960 --> 00:19.640]  defines genocide as acts committed with intent to destroy a racial or ethnic group. Is Israel
[00:19.640 --> 00:25.800]  providing Gaza with medical supplies, electricity, and food part of this genocide? Isn't it odd
[00:25.800 --> 00:32.400]  that in schools, hospitals, and public spaces in Israel, you see Jews, Christians, and Muslims
[00:32.400 --> 00:38.120]  living together? Not much of a genocide strategy, don't you think? We need to question what

[00:29.760 --> 00:35.320]  Yep, not your typical war criminal behavior, huh? And while we're on it, have you thought
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.520]  about the thousands of Israeli children living with the constant threat of rocket attacks?

[00:35.600 --> 00:41.920]  freely. And daily terror? Well, if it's a two-way street with rocket attacks from Gaza,

[00:10.000 --> 00:13.000]  This would have been a time of joy.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  Instead, we are mourning.
[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  We are fearful.
[00:20.000 --> 00:24.000]  More than 20,000 killed.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  As still under the rubble.
[00:27.000 --> 00:33.000]  Close to 9,000 children killed in the most brutal ways.
[00:33.000 --> 00:42.000]  Day after day, 1.9 million displaced hundreds of thousands of homes destroyed.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  Resa, as we know it no longer exists.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  This is an annihilation.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  This is a genocide.
[00:52.000 --> 00:54.000]  The world is watching.
[00:54.000 --> 00:57.000]  Churches are watching.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  The people of Resa are sending life images of their own execution.
[01:03.000 --> 01:06.000]  Maybe the world cares.
[01:06.000 --> 01:09.000]  But it goes on.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.000]  We are asking here.
[01:11.000 --> 01:13.000]  Could this be our fate and Bethlehem?
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  And Ramallah.
[01:15.000 --> 01:20.000]  In Janine is this our destiny too.
[01:21.000 --> 01:25.000]  We are tormented by the silence of the world.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  Leaders of the so-called free, lined up one after the other.
[01:31.000 --> 01:38.000]  To give the green light for this genocide against a captive population.
[01:38.000 --> 01:41.000]  They gave the cover.
[01:41.000 --> 01:46.000]  Not only did they make sure to pay the bill in advance.
[01:46.000 --> 01:49.000]  They veiled the truth and context.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  They were fighting the political cover.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  And yet another layer has been added.
[01:57.000 --> 01:59.000]  The theological cover.
[01:59.000 --> 02:05.000]  With the Western Church stepping into the spotlight.
[02:05.000 --> 02:10.000]  Our dear friends in South Africa taught us the concept of the state theology.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  Define as theology.
[02:12.000 --> 02:16.000]  The theological justification of the status quo with its racism,
[02:16.000 --> 02:20.000]  capitalism and totalitarianism.
[02:20.000 --> 02:28.000]  It does so by misusing theological concepts and biblical text for its own political purposes.
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  Here in Palestine the Bible is weaponized against us.
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  Our very own sacred text.
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  In our terminology in Palestine we speak of the Empire.
[02:44.000 --> 02:47.000]  We confront the theology of Empire.
[02:47.000 --> 02:55.000]  A disguise for superiority, supremacy, chosenness and entitlement.
[02:55.000 --> 03:02.000]  It is sometimes given a nice cover using words like mission and evangelism,
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  full filament of prophecy and spreading freedom and liberty.
[03:08.000 --> 03:17.000]  The theology of the Empire becomes a powerful tool to mask oppression under the clock of divine sanction.
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.000]  It speaks of land without people.
[03:22.000 --> 03:31.000]  It divides people into us and then it dehumanizes and demonizes the concept of land without people again.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  Even though they knew too well that the land had people and not just any people,
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.000]  it's very special people.
[03:39.000 --> 03:46.000]  Theology of the Empire calls for empty ink, just like it called for the ethnic cleansing in 1948,
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  a miracle or a divine miracle as they called it.
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.000]  It calls for us Palestinians now to go to Egypt, maybe Jordan, why not just the sea?
[03:59.000 --> 04:05.000]  I think of the words of the disciples to Jesus when he was about to enter Samirian.
[04:05.000 --> 04:12.000]  Lord, do you want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.000]  They said of the Samiritans.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  This is the theology of the Empire.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  This is what they're saying about us today.
[04:22.000 --> 04:30.000]  This word has confirmed to us that the world does not see us as equal.
[04:30.000 --> 04:33.000]  Maybe it's the color of our skins.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  Maybe it is because we are on the wrong side of a political equation.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  Even our kingship in Christ did not shield us.
[04:44.000 --> 04:51.000]  So they say if it takes killing 100 Palestinians to get the single Hamas militant then so be it.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  We are not humans in their eyes.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  But in God's eyes, no one can tell us that.
[05:01.000 --> 05:08.000]  The hypocrisy and racism of the Western world is transparent and appalling.
[05:08.000 --> 05:13.000]  They always take the word of Palestinians with suspicion and qualification.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  No word not treated equally.
[05:15.000 --> 05:21.000]  Yet on the other side, despite a clear track record of misinformation lies,
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  their words are almost always deemed infallible.
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.000]  To our European friends, I never ever want to hear your lecture us on human rights or international law again.
[05:34.000 --> 05:37.000]  And I mean this.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  We are not white, I guess.
[05:39.000 --> 05:48.000]  It does not apply to us according to your own logic.
[05:48.000 --> 05:56.000]  In this war, the many Christians in the Western world made sure the Empire has the theology needed.
[05:57.000 --> 06:02.000]  It is that self-defense we were told and I continue to ask,
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  how is the killing of 9,000 children's self-defense?
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  How is the displacement of 1.9 million Palestinians self-defense?
[06:12.000 --> 06:19.000]  They are the colonizer into the victim and the colonized into the aggressor.
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  Have we forgotten? Have we forgotten that the state they talked to?
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  The that state was built on the ruins of the towns and villages of those very same cousins.
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  Have they forgotten?
[06:37.000 --> 06:42.000]  We are outraged by the complicity of the church.
[06:42.000 --> 06:48.000]  Let it be clear, friends. Silence is complicity.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  And empty calls for peace without a ceasefire and anti-occupation.
[06:53.000 --> 07:02.000]  And the shallow words of empathy without direct action all under the banner of complicity.
[07:02.000 --> 07:05.000]  So here is my message.
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  Reset today has become the moral compass of the world.
[07:10.000 --> 07:16.000]  Reset was held before October 7 and the world was signed.
[07:16.000 --> 07:20.000]  Should we be surprised that their silence now?
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  If you are not appalled by what is happening in Gaza,
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  if you are not shaken to your core, there is something wrong with your humanity.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  And if we ask Christians are not outraged by the genocide,
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.000]  by the weaponization of the Bible to justify it,
[07:39.000 --> 07:42.000]  there is something wrong with our Christian witness
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.000]  and we are compromising the credibility of our gospel message.
[07:49.000 --> 07:53.000]  If you fail to call this a genocide that is on you,
[07:53.000 --> 07:59.000]  it is a sin and a darkness you willingly embrace.
[07:59.000 --> 08:05.000]  Some have not even called for a ceasefire. I'm talking about churches.
[08:05.000 --> 08:09.000]  I feel sorry for you. We will be okay.
[08:10.000 --> 08:16.000]  Despite the immense blow we have endured, we the Palestinians were recovered.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  We were rise. We will stand up again from the midst of destruction
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  as we have always done as Palestinians.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  Although this is by far, maybe the biggest blow we have received in a long time,
[08:29.000 --> 08:31.000]  but we will be okay.
[08:31.000 --> 08:35.000]  But for those who are complicit, I feel sorry for you.
[08:35.000 --> 08:39.000]  Will you ever recover from this?
[08:39.000 --> 08:46.000]  Your charity and your words of shock after the genocide won't make a difference.
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  And I know these words of shocks are coming,
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  and I know people will give generously for charity.
[08:54.000 --> 09:00.000]  But your words won't make a difference. Words of regret won't satisfy for you.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  And let me say it, we will not accept your apology after the genocide.
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.000]  What has been done has been done.
[09:10.000 --> 09:13.000]  I want you to look at the mirror and ask,
[09:13.000 --> 09:21.000]  where was I when Hazel was going through a genocide?
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  To our friends who are here with us,
[09:25.000 --> 09:31.000]  you have left your families and churches to be with us.
[09:31.000 --> 09:37.000]  You embody the term a complement, costly solidarity.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  Think of the words of Jesus.
[09:39.000 --> 09:44.000]  We were imprisoned and you visited us.
[09:44.000 --> 09:54.000]  What a stark difference from the silence and complicity of others that you are here.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  Your presence here is the meaning of solidarity.

[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Ah, an alien invasion. Nope, just another misinformed TikTok. Let's debunk, shall we? You say annihilation, genocide. Scary words, but not backed by reality. Did you know that Israel has an Arab minority of 20%? And they enjoy the same rights, legal protections, access to health care and education as their Jewish compatriots?
[00:25.000 --> 00:47.000]  Doesn't sound like annihilation, does it? And did you know that Israel accepted UN's partition plan in 1947 while Arab nations didn't? There's two sides to every story, folks. So, before you let 15-second videos dictate your understanding, maybe do some fact-checking yourself. Cool? Cool.

[00:19.760 --> 00:26.960]  living by it. You know, things like freedom, justice, equality, sounds familiar, right?
[00:26.960 --> 00:32.480]  And superiority? Please, Israel is the only country in the Middle East where everyone,
[00:32.480 --> 00:39.440]  Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, you name it, can vote, express their opinions freely,
[00:39.440 --> 00:42.720]  and live in peace. Now how's that for empire behavior?

[00:19.320 --> 00:24.800]  Funny, considering Israel is the only place in the Middle East where everyone, regardless
[00:24.800 --> 00:29.600]  of gender or religion, has equal rights. Cherry picking information much?

[00:20.360 --> 00:26.680]  to causes, without filters or tricks. Can we say the same about everywhere else?
